                        <li>Strengths:I am very resourceful: When the pandamic came, I decided to close my daycare and i rolled my qualifications over to

                        catering, Uber, School Bus Driver, House keeper and as a hairstylist. Most people in my personal life at church and
                        among my family and acquintences also come to me tro counsel because I tend to be objective and non-judgemental.</li>
